This led me to study social work - with the desire to better understand people and support them on their path toward justice and self-determination. As a social worker, I have worked with unaccompanied minor refugees and adults in the asylum sector, with people affected by substance use (therapy as well as harm reduction and prevention), and with women, children and adolescents in challenging life phases.",
      "p2": "I have experienced many highs and lows - personal crises, new beginnings, growth steps. A formative time was my years in Latin America, where I lived and worked for almost eight years. These years profoundly changed me as a person and as a professional. Over time, I realized that every wish for change on the outside begins within ourselves. The path to self-knowledge is often challenging - and that is exactly where coaching and energy work entered my life. They became powerful companions on my own inner journey. All these experiences now flow into my work: in coaching, energy work and as a companion on the path.",
