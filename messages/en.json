      "p1": "From early on, I’ve been interested in what moves people on the inside and how real change actually happens. Questions of justice, inner freedom and self-determination have shaped my path from the very beginning. Driven by this, I studied Social Work with the goal of accompanying people through challenging life phases in a professional, respectful and equal way.\n\nIn my work, I’ve had the privilege of getting to know many different life realities. I supported unaccompanied minor refugees, worked with adults in the asylum sector, assisted people affected by substance dependence - in therapy, harm reduction and prevention - and accompanied women, children and adolescents through sensitive transitions and crisis periods. Every encounter has taught me how much strength, vulnerability and wisdom lives within each person.",
      "p2": "My own path has also been shaped by highs and lows: personal crises, new beginnings, inner transformation processes. Especially formative were my almost eight years in Latin America. That time changed me deeply - as a human being and as a professional. There I learned to relate to life with more trust, depth and connection.\n\nOver the years, it became clear to me: true change does not begin on the outside. It begins where we meet ourselves honestly. This path isn’t always comfortable - but it is healing. During this phase, coaching and energy work entered my life. They helped me recognize old patterns, release inner blocks and come closer to my own truth.",
      "p3": "Today, all of these experiences flow into my work. I combine professional competence with presence, life experience and a refined sense for what truly matters. In my coaching and energy work, I create a safe space where you can feel seen, heard and taken seriously - and where personal growth and inner stability become possible.\n\n<strong>I am convinced:</strong>\nEvery person already carries the power for change within.\nSometimes all it takes is the right space - and mindful support - for that power to unfold.",
